# The Simulation of the Universe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

The `seed.html` is a file that contains script to run the entire universe.<br>
The basic principles of the universe is that it has causes and effects.

_So what cause the universe to form?_

Universe itself contains of `space` and `time`. To accomodate the basis of<br>
the universe is by simulating these two elements in our script program.<br>
The idea is by placing an equation to form the `atoms` that rendered by a<br>
2-dimensional space of our monitor and the `ticks` of time by the thread<br>
of loop that run by the script.

Thus, If the program happens to form something that looks like our existing<br>
universe and the more simple the program is, the more the likely answer to the<br>
problem we get.
